1.	From the dataset of 4,000 past projects, these trends can be drawn:

    a.	Of successful Kickstarter campaigns, the most count of successful campaigns were among the categories of Theater, Music, and Film         & Video.  
    
    b.	Theater had the greatest number of successful campaigns.  Of the sub-categories of Theater, Plays had the most successful                 campaigns.  
    
    c.	In the total of the data set, more Kickstarter campaigns were successful than failed or cancelled.   
    
2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?  

    a.	Less than 10 years of data (The dataset is from 2009-2017, so missing most recent data if trends have changed since then)  
    
    b.	Less than 5,000 campaigns (more data can be used in future studies)  
    
    c.	We donâ€™t know how much each backer donated
